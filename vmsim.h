 * \brief  The interface for the `vmsim` library.
 * \author Prof. Scott F. Kaplan
 * \date   Fall 2018
 *
 * `vmsim` is a package that emulates a 32-bit virtual address space.  It
 * provides a _simulated address space_ that is mapped onto a _real address
 * space_.  The real storage is created by the library, while a full 32-bit
 * range of simulated addresses are mapped, on demand, onto that real storage
 * space, which can be of any size.  Space is created and mapped in 4 KB pages.
 * Access to simulated storage is provided by the `vimsim_read()` and
 * `vmsim_write()` functions.
