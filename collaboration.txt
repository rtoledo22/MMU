[This is a template for your project collaboration document.  Please briefly answer the following questions in whatever format you'd lik. Try to stay within 500 words unless there is an issue/bug requiring additional explanation.]

(1) Who did you collaborate with or recieve help/insight from during this project, and how did they help?
I talked to Professor Pentecost multiple times, and went to office hours on both Tuesday and Thursday.

(2) What went well for you in this project?
After a certain point everything just clicked! It took me a day to do everything, and up to a certain point I understood what 80% of the code did.

(3) What was challenging for you in this project?
The entirety of time it took me to get to the point everything clicked. Conceptually it was tough to understand what was happening, though once I went to TA hours after office hours I had that moment of clarity.

(4) Did you consult any online sources in developing the code you are submitting?  Please list any sources and how/why you used them.  Note that any code or bug-fixes directly used in your code should be well-commented *by you* to indicate your understanding.

Uh... Let's see... I used Project 0, Project 1, and Project 2 instructions from the Moodle website.

I used this to find out how to put command line arguments to use: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6121094/how-do-i-run-a-program-with-commandline-arguments-using-gdb-within-a-bash-script

I used this to understand bitmasking and bit augmentation in more detail, since I was getting confused with >> and <<: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10493411/what-is-bit-masking#:~:text=Masking%20is%20the%20act%20of%20applying%20a%20mask,a%20subset%20of%20the%20bits%20in%20the%20value

There were a lot of websites I used to try and understand 32-bit addresses and why my less-than-32-bit address was not being masked the way I thought it would, and there were a lot of websites to understand how to use gdb, for example how to enable the gdb to go through c code line by line via -g.
